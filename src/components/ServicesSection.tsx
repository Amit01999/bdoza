                  Bangladesh is quickly becoming a key player in the global
                  economy, but companies that import goods into the country find
                  it difficult to navigate customs. Especially when there are
                  many rules and regulations that you, as an importer, do not
                  always know about.

                  The customs clearance process at Chittagong Port in Bangladesh
                  can be difficult and time-consuming. The slightest mistake can
                  cause delays in releasing your imported raw materials and
                  capital machinery and even subject you to penalties â€“ which
                  can impact your revenue negatively.
